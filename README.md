- 👋 Hi, I’m @fe051 - I live in Ottawa, Canada with my spouse and pets.
- 👀 I’m interested in ancient software, archive documentation, vintage programs, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 6800x assembler.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that captures my attention. Old games, old utilities, old documents.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just do it right on Github, comrade. :-)
